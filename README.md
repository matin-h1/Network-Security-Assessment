# Network-Security-Assessment

## Objective

The Network Security Assessment project aimed to evaluate and enhance the security of the home network environment. The primary objective was to identify vulnerabilities and implement basic security measures to protect personal devices and data from common cyber threats. This project provided an opportunity to learn fundamental cybersecurity concepts and practices applicable to home network environments.

### Skills Learned

- Basic understanding of home network architecture and components.
- Proficiency in identifying common security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
- Ability to implement basic security measures to protect home network devices and data.
- Experience in configuring network security settings and access controls.
- Development of proactive security habits and practices for securing home networks.

### Tools Used

- Router administration interface for configuring network settings and access controls.
- Antivirus software for scanning and removing malware from devices.
- Firewall software for blocking unauthorized network traffic.
- Network scanner tools for identifying connected devices and open ports on the home network.
  
## Steps

- Conduct an inventory of devices connected to the home network, including computers, smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, and IoT devices.
- Log in to the router administration interface using the default gateway IP address and administrator credentials.
- Review and update the router firmware to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
- Change the default router password to a strong, unique password to prevent unauthorized access.
- Configure Wi-Fi encryption settings (WPA2 or WPA3) and set a strong Wi-Fi password to secure wireless network access.
- Enable the built-in firewall feature on the router to block unauthorized inbound and outbound network traffic.
- Install and configure antivirus software on computers and devices connected to the home network to detect and remove malware.
- Set up guest network access on the router to isolate guest devices from the main home network.
- Use network scanner tools to identify connected devices and check for any unauthorized devices or open ports on the home network.
- Enable automatic software updates on devices to ensure they receive security patches and updates regularly.
- Document the security measures implemented and create a checklist for regular security maintenance and monitoring of the home network.
